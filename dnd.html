Alcohol and drug use is commonplace, and parties are routinely hosted around the Golden Elderwood at least once a week to honour the bountiful harvests and gifts that the massive tree, which is the symbol of the city, has given them over the years.

While not all of those in this group, called the Creators, are gnomes, the vast majority are. Their primary goal is to invent new things. The city is lit by electric-powered contraptions, and automated guards patrol to deter criminal activity. Most settlements have some connection to Arcfast to make use of their resources, and the Azure Order collaborates extensively to ensure that the people of Drakivir are well-protected.

However, the giants seek to expand their power while guarding the land they have already claimed. It is here that some of the best weapons and armours are forged using the heat from the magma below. While the fortress only housed a few hundred giants a few months ago, an agreement made between the Fire Giants, as well as numerous clans of Orcs and Hobgoblins throughout Drakivir has led to an influx of residents.
